The cumulative daily number of deaths in regions across Brazil is treated as continuous curves (functional data). The first stage of the analysis applies clustering methods for functional data to identify and describe potential heterogeneity in the curves and their functional derivatives. The estimated clusters are labeled with different “levels of alert” to identify cities in a possible critical situation. In the second stage of the analysis, we apply a functional quantile regression model for the death curves to explore the associations with functional rates of vaccination and stringency and also with several scalar geographical, socioeconomic and demographic covariates. The proposed model gave a better curve fit at different levels of the cumulative number of deaths when compared to a functional regression model based on ordinary least squares. Our results add to the understanding of the development of COVID-19 death counts.</p> (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)</li>

Background 
The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) required a sampling methodology that allowed for production of timely population-based clinical estimates to inform the ongoing US COVID-19 pandemic response. 
Methods 
We developed a flexible sampling approach that considered reporting delays, differential hospitalized case burden across surveillance sites, and changing geographic and demographic trends over time. We incorporated weighting methods to adjust for the probability of selection and non-response, and to calibrate the sampled case distribution to the population distribution on demographics. We additionally developed procedures for variance estimation. 
Results 
Between March 2020 and June 2021, 19,293 (10.4%) of all adult hospitalized cases were sampled for chart abstraction. Variance estimates for select variables of interest were within desired ranges. 
Conclusions 
COVID-NET's sampling methodology allowed for reporting of robust and timely, population-based data on the clinical epidemiology of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and evolving trends over time, while attempting to reduce data collection burden on surveillance sites. Such methods may provide a general framework for other surveillance systems needing to quickly and efficiently collect and disseminate data for public health action.</p> (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)</li>

A cross-sectional and retrospective study of patients with Mycobacterium spp. in a Portuguese tertiary hospital, in 2009 and 2019, was performed to understand better the rise in isolations of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The number of patients with positive samples for Mycobacterium spp. grew from 56 in 2009 to 83 in 2019. The proportion of NTM rose from 39.3% to 49.4% (P = 0.240), with Mycobacterium avium complex being more frequent in 2009 and Mycobacterium gordonae in 2019, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex decreased from 60.7% to 50.6%. Higher age was associated with NTM in both years, and pulmonary disease and immunosuppression were associated with NTM in 2019 (P &lt; 0.05), with weak to moderate correlation (V = 0.231–0.343). The overall rise of NTM, allied to their known capacity to resist antimicrobial therapy, alerts clinicians to the importance of recognising potential risk factors for infection and improving future prevention strategies.

Background: Establishing a large study network to conduct influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) studies while collecting appropriate variables to account for potential bias is important; the most relevant variables should be prioritized. We explored the impact of potential confounders on IVE in the DRIVE multi-country network of sites conducting test-negative design (TND) studies. 
Methods: We constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the relationship between influenza vaccination, medically attended influenza infection, confounders, and other variables. Additionally, we used the Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccines Effectiveness (DRIVE) data from the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons to explore the effect of covariate adjustment on IVE estimates. The reference model was adjusted for age, sex, calendar time, and season. The covariates studied were presence of at least one, two, or three chronic diseases; presence of six specific chronic diseases; and prior healthcare use. Analyses were conducted by site and subsequently pooled. 
Results: The following variables were included in the DAG: age, sex, time within influenza season and year, health status and comorbidities, study site, health-care-seeking behavior, contact patterns and social precautionary behavior, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing immunity. Across all age groups and settings, only adjustment for lung disease in older adults in the primary care setting resulted in a relative change of the IVE point estimate &gt;10%. 
Conclusion: Our study supports a parsimonious approach to confounder adjustment in TND studies, limited to adjusting for age, sex, and calendar time. Practical implications are that necessitating fewer variables lowers the threshold for enrollment of sites in IVE studies and simplifies the pooling of data from different IVE studies or study networks.</p> (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)</li>

                    This paper examines the short-term or transient dynamics of SIR infectious disease models in patch environments. We employ reactivity of an equilibrium and amplification rates, concepts from ecology, to analyze how dispersals/travels between patches, spatial heterogeneity, and other disease-related parameters impact short-term dynamics. Our findings reveal that in certain scenarios, due to the impact of spatial heterogeneity and the dispersals, the short-term disease dynamics over a patch environment may disagree with the long-term disease dynamics that is typically reflected by the basic reproduction number. Such an inconsistence can mislead the public, public healthy agencies and governments when making public health policy and decisions, and hence, these findings are of practical importance.</p> (link.springer.com)</li>

We ask whether most species in disturbed habitats fall into similar categories with respect to being strong competitors versus colonizers using a conceptual framework based on how species assemble into plots over time. Our study uses a replicated disturbance experiment, coupled with close tracking of plant cover and native seedlings, as well as a native outplanting experiment, across six dominant vegetation types, including native and invader-dominated, in old pasture habitats in Hawaiʻi. Our results highlight that the altered states across formerly grazed landscapes in Hawaiʻi are stable to disturbance, and point to the importance of resident communities and their effects on species interactions and seed availability in shaping plant community response to disturbance. 
 
Abstract 
Non-native-dominated landscapes may arise from invasion by competitive plant species, disturbance and invasion of early-colonizing species, or some combination of these. Without knowing site history, however, it is difficult to predict how native or non-native communities will reassemble after disturbance events. Given increasing disturbance levels across anthropogenically impacted landscapes, predictive understanding of these patterns is important. We asked how disturbance affected community assembly in six invaded habitat types common in dryland, grazed landscapes on Island of Hawai‘i. We mechanically disturbed 100 m2 plots in six vegetation types dominated by one of four invasive perennial grasses (Cenchrus ciliaris, Cenchrus clandestinus, Cenchrus setaceus, or Melinis repens), a native shrub (Dodonaea viscosa), or a native perennial bunchgrass (Eragrostis atropioides). We censused vegetation before disturbance and monitored woody plant colonization and herbaceous cover for 21 months following the disturbance, categorizing species as competitors, colonizers, or a combination, based on recovery patterns. In addition, we planted individuals of the native shrub and bunchgrass and monitored survival to overcome dispersal limitation of native species when exploring these patterns. We found that the dominant vegetation types showed variation in post-disturbance syndrome, and that the variation in colonizer versus competitor syndrome occurred both between species, but also within species among different vegetation types. Although there were flushes of native shrub seedlings, these did not survive to 21 months within invaded habitats, probably due to regrowth by competitive invasive grasses. Similarly, survival of planted native individuals was related to the rate of regrowth by dominant species. Regardless of colonization/competitor syndrome, however, all dominant vegetation types were relatively resilient to change. Our results highlight that the altered post-agricultural, invaded grassland landscapes in Hawaiʻi are stable states. More generally, they point to the importance of resident communities and their effects on species interactions and seed availability in shaping plant community response to disturbance.</p> (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)</li>

The choice between individually and cluster randomized designs is often driven by the target estimand of interest (eg, direct versus total), statistical power, and, importantly, logistic feasibility. To combat emerging infectious disease threats, especially when the number of events from one single trial may not be adequate to obtain vaccine effect estimates with a desired level of precision, it may be necessary to combine information across multiple trials. In this article, we propose a model formulation to estimate the direct, indirect, total, and overall vaccine effects combining data from trials with two types of study designs: individual-randomization and cluster-randomization, based on a Cox proportional hazards model, where the hazard of infection depends on both vaccine status of the individual as well as the vaccine status of the other individuals in the same cluster. We illustrate the use of the proposed model and assess the potential efficiency gain from combining data from multiple trials, compared to using data from each individual trial alone, through two simulation studies, one of which is designed based on a cholera vaccine trial previously carried out in Matlab, Bangladesh.</p> (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)</li>

Establishing clinical suspicion is challenging if risk factors or clinical features classically associated with tularemia are absent. Tularemia is treatable with antibiotics; however, there are limited data to inform management of potentially fatal neuroinvasive infection.MethodsWe collected epidemiologic and clinical data on 2 recent US cases of neuroinvasive F. tularensis infection, and performed a literature review of cases of neuroinvasive F. tularensis infection published after 1950.ResultsOne patient presented with focal neurologic deficits and brain lesions; broad-range molecular testing on resected brain tissue detected F. tularensis. The other patient presented with meningeal signs; tularemia was suspected based on animal exposure, and F. tularensis grew in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Both patients received combination antibiotic therapy and recovered from infection. Among 16 published cases, tularemia was clinically suspected in 4 cases. CSF often displayed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Among cases with available data, CSF culture was positive in 13 of 16 cases, and F. tularensis antibodies were detected in 11 of 11 cases. Treatment typically included an aminoglycoside combined with either a tetracycline or a fluoroquinolone. Outcomes were generally favorable.ConclusionsClinicians should consider neuroinvasive F. tularensis infection in patients with meningitis and signs suggestive of tularemia or compatible exposures, lymphocyte-predominant CSF, unrevealing standard microbiologic workup, or lack of response to empiric bacterial meningitis treatment. Molecular testing, culture, and serologic testing can reveal the diagnosis. Favorable outcomes can be achieved with directed antibiotic treatment.</p> (academic.oup.com)</li>

The US Food and Drug Administration’s Animal Model Qualification Program under the Drug Development Tools Program is a regulatory pathway for animal models used in MCM efficacy testing and approval under the Animal Rule. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority worked together to qualify the cynomolgus macaque model of pneumonic tularemia.MethodsUsing the model parameters and end points defined in the qualified model, efficacy of the antibiotics doxycycline and ciprofloxacin was evaluated in separate studies. Antibiotic administration, aimed to model approved human dosing, was initiated at time points of 24 hours or 48 hours after onset of fever as an indicator of disease.ResultsUpon aerosol exposure (target dose of 1000 colony-forming units) to Francisella tularensis SchuS4, 80% of vehicle-treated macaques succumbed or were euthanized. Ciprofloxacin treatment led to 10 of 10 animals surviving irrespective of treatment time. Doxycycline administered at 48 hours post-fever led to 10 of 10 animals surviving, while 9/10 animals survived in the group treated with doxycycline 24 hours after fever. Selected surviving animals in both the placebo and doxycycline 48-hour group showed residual live bacteria in peripheral tissues, while there were no bacteria in tissues from ciprofloxacin-treated macaques.ConclusionsBoth doxycycline and ciprofloxacin were efficacious in treatment of pneumonic tularemia, although clearance of bacteria may be different between the 2 drugs.</p> (academic.oup.com)</li>

The aim of this study was to examine whether there is a relationship between IMD and asymptomatic oropharyngeal carriage of meningococci by spatial analysis to identify the distribution and patterns of cases and carriage in South Australia (SA). Carriage data geocoded to participants’ residential addresses and meningococcal case notifications using Postal Area (POA) centroids were used to analyse spatial distribution by disease- and non-disease-associated genogroups, as well as overall from 2017 to 2020. The majority of IMD cases were genogroup B with the overall highest incidence of cases reported in infants, young children, and adolescents. We found no clear spatial association between N. meningitidis carriage and IMD cases. However, analyses using carriage and case genogroups showed differences in the spatial distribution between metropolitan and regional areas. Regional areas had a higher rate of IMD cases and carriage prevalence. While no clear relationship between cases and carriage was evident in the spatial analysis, the higher rates of both carriage and disease in regional areas highlight the need to maintain high vaccine coverage outside of the well-resourced metropolitan area.</p> (dx.doi.org)</li>
